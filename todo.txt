- prepare each sub-package to be individually importable/pip installable

i want pip install gapprox to install all subpackages
i want pip install gapprox_component to install gapprox_component so only certain components can be upgraded
i want only import gapprox to be available and to import all components
i want from gapprox import component to be available
i want separate versioning for components

its kinda like how installing plasma installs many packages that are related and updated independently but they still work together as one coherent piece
