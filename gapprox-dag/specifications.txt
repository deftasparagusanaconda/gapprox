gapprox-DAG is an IR (intermediate representation) system that preserves number set (complex, real, etc.) and represents variables, numbers, functions, and equations as a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

it maintains the following number type hierarchy, where each set is a subset of the next:
B - Boolean    = False, True
N - Natural    = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
W - Whole      = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
Z - Integer    = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...
P - Rational   = 1.6, -0.22, ...
R - Real       = pi, e, ...
C - Complex    = 1+0i, 2+2i, ...
H - Quaternion = (wont be implemented unless commissioned)
O - Octonion   = (wont be implemented unless commissioned)
V - Vector     = [1, 2, 3, ...], (2, 1, 4, ...), ...

the following are related, but do not fit nicely in the tree:
Q - Irrational (superclass of Integer) = numbers that cannot be represented as a fraction of integers
  - GaussianInteger (subset of Complex, superset of Integer) = complex with integer coefficients
  - GaussianRational (subset of Complex, superset of Rational) = complex with rational coefficients
