# graphapproximator
a collection of tools and an application to help you find the approximate shape of any 2D graph

---
## üîß how to use
run it as an app:
```shell
./launcher.sh
```
or:
```python
python3 launcher.py
# "python3 launcher.py --headless" to launch the CLI!
```
or run it as a python package ^-^
```python
import graphapproximator as ga

mypoints = [ (1,1), (2,3), (4,3), (-2,-1), (-4,-5), (5,7) ]
print(ga.line(mypoints))
# f(x) = 0.2 + 1.1333333333333333*x
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è how it works

![engine.webp](<https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/graphapproximator/blob/main/documentation/diagrams/engine.webp> "engine.webp")

each interface (API/CLI/GUI/webUI) talks to a single *"Engine"* instance  
this object manages your current configuration of generator, expression, interpolator, ...  
the _Engine_ also exposes a list of available modules (generators, expressions, interpolators, ...)  

input: provided by API/CLI/GUI/webUI  
parser: decodes string input into symbolic math input  
interpolator: converts discrete points into a smooth function, then samples it  
generator: generates parameters for an expression  
expression: turns parameters into a math expression  
output: passed to API/CLI/GUI/webUI  

each module is optional. if you didn't define it, the data simply passes through  
there are also other standalone features like extrapolator, outlier, ...  

![iterative optimizer.webp](<https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/graphapproximator/blob/main/documentation/diagrams/iterative optimizer.webp> "iterative optimizer.webp")

the iterative optimizer is a special kind of generator  
it is an instance of *"IterativeOptimizer"*  
this object manages your current configuration of expression, error, predictor, ...  

input: provided by API/CLI/GUI  
expression: turns parameters into a math expression  
error: calculates the discordance between original input and approximation  
predictor: find the next best set of parameters to minimize error  
output: passed to API/CLI/GUI  

the iterative optimizer runs until it reaches an end condition, such as time_limit, iter_limit, ...  
it is also capable of multithreading/parallel processing  

tl;dr wishy washy; class instances for stateful tools, modules for everything else THE END.
