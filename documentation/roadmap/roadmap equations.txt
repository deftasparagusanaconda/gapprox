equations are functions

# analytic perspective ---------------------------------------------------------

# take an equation y = x². this represents a parabola in 2D space. quite simple.
take the inequation y < x². its an area outlining the graph under the parabola
how are these two related?

the original equation y = x² can be rewritten as 0 = x² - y, and we can replace the LHS with z
so, z = x² - y

wherever z is 0 represents the equation y = x²
wherever z is -ve represents the inequation y < x²
wherever z is +ve represents the inequation y > x²

thus the equation is converted to a function. the inputs are x and y, and the output is z. therefore we get a surface.

in general, for an equation with n inputs, we can construct a manifold of n dimension in n+1 space. the projection/intersection of that manifold on the input axes is the graph of the equation.

# DAG perspective --------------------------------------------------------------

consider two expressions 2 + x and 3 * y. they are expression trees like:
      +             *
     / \    and    / \
    2   x         3   y

now, consider the equation 2 + x = 3 * y. this is two expression trees connected together through an = 

2             3
 \           /
  + -- = -- *
 /           \
x             y

this is two DAGs facing each other with opposing directions, and their roots connecting to each other through the = operator
this graph can be changed to create a normal tree:

      =
     / \
    /   \
   /     \  
  +       *
 / \     / \
2   x   3   y

and now the equation is represented as an expression tree, the same format as a function. 

the equation is a function because the comparison operator (=, <, >, ...) is just an operator like +, -, *, ... but unlike the others, it returns a boolean, not a real. in the results section, the functionality of the comparison operator is extended to output reals

# results ----------------------------------------------------------------------

the comparison operators are just like any other normal operators like +, -, *, and, or, ...
thus equations are just functions. furthermore, to prove that equations do not represent many-many relations, but are actually projections of higher-dimensional manifolds which look like many-many, let us take the equation of a circle:

x² + y² = 1

this can be rewritten as:

0 = 1 - x² - y²
z = 1 - x² - y² or f(x, y) = 1 - x² - y³

thus, wherever z = 0 is the circle
the equation form of a circle is actually a surface in 3D, whose intersection with the z = 0 plane represents a circle

an analogy is how the parametric form of a circle is often taken to be 
(cos t, sin t) 

but the full form is:
(cos t, sin t, t)

the full form represents a path in 3D space, which when projected onto the 2D x-y plane creates a circle, which is a many-many relation
similarly, equations have one hidden output variable and when projected onto only the input variables, it creates a many-many relation 

this result can be used to plot equations like functions. for example, finding points that exactly satisfy the equation of a circle x² + y² = 1 is incredibly hard for limited-precision computers. the limited precision of the calculations prevents perfect equality. instead, the height map z = f(x, y) = 1 - x² - y² is taken and herever the surface is in -0.1 < z < 0.1 is taken as the approximation

# things that i have discovered ------------------------------------------------

- comparison operators are the same as any other, like +, -, *, and, or, ...
- equations are functions that include one comparison operator
- thus comparison operators can be used more than once in a statement (like (x=y)=True) although this involves mixing the boolean and real sets of numbers
- functions are one conventional "expression", and are already implied to have an output like y = or f(x) =
- equations are not commonly implied to have an output. but like functions, they always have one output extra
- extension of an equation of n inputs to an n-dimensional manifold in n+1 space

# conclusion -------------------------------------------------------------------

relational symbols are comparison operators, which operate the same as other operators
equations/inequations are functions with at least one comparison operator
thus, like functions, an equation with n inputs can be represented by an n-dimensional manifold in n+1 space

# rant ------------------------------------------------------------------------

this result also kind of proves why x = y = z represents a line. or does it?

why does x = y = z represent a line? its three inputs. so it should be a 3D manifold (volume) in 4D space, right?
perhaps equations are not functions, but equations can be *extended* into functions?

first, reduce to smaller dimensions. why does y = x represent a line? this is an equation. an equation can be extended to a function like so:
0 = x - y
z = x - y

and wherever z = 0 is the line. so the line is a projection 

hmm... i realized... x = y = z is shorthand for x = y, y = z which is a system of equations
(then what is something like (1+x=y) = 2? anyway...)

how does a system of equations/inequations turn into a line? a system of m equations of n inputs has m manifolds of n dimension in n+1 space
in the case of x = y = z, the intersection of the two manifolds is considered, and i think that is probably projected onto 

in x = y = z, we have a system of 2 equations, each of 2 inputs, so we have 2 surfaces in 3D. the intersection of 2 surfaces is a line (at least by the m+n-k rule of manifold intersection. here, m=n=2 and k=3 since its a 3D space). and we still operate in a 3D space. so we get a line in 3D space. it is the result of the intersection of two manifolds in 3D, where were the result of extending two equations to functions.

# for graphapproximator --------------------------------------------------------

graphapproximator can now understand equations as functions. and it is already familiar with functions
