if ga will be able to support multiple input functions, effectively it will be able to support scalar fields
take for example a 2D scalar field: f(x,y) = x + y
it is two inputs, one output, thus representable in 3 dimensions

a scalar field can be extended to have direction, making it a vector field
(im not sure how direction will be extracted, but say we could)

the tricky part is that direction is not a new dimension
the original 2D scalar field example f(x,y) = x + y outputs a real number
instead of this, for a vector field, it should output two real numbers
thus, it returns a vector for a given x and y. for example: f(x,y) = (xÂ², y+2)

and so instead of points being a simple set of cartesian coordinates, they are vectors.
*all* the components will have to support vectors, but this may open the door for field modelling, perhaps?
i am not sure exactly what supporting vectors will mean. but it should have some profound meaning im not yet sure of
