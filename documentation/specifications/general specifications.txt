a 2D graph (technically, a path on a 2D surface) can be represented in the following ways:

string: "2 + x + x^2"
function: def func(x): return 2+x+x**2
points: [x1, x2, x3, ...], [y1, y2, y3, y4]

functions that take points array should take them as 
myfunc((input_array_1, input_array_2, input_array_3, ...), output_array, other arguments)
this develops a clear visual that there is always only one output array, and that for multiple outputs, multiple approximations are just running at the same time
this is the convention in ML, and across scikit, xgboost, pytorch, tensorflow, julia, caret, statsmodels,
