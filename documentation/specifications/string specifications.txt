expressions can be stored as strings
strings should follow academic mathematical conventional notation as much as possible:
- ^ instead of **
- 1/2x is interpreted as 1/2*x (although implied multiplication should be avoided)
- sin, cos, tan, ..., all trig functions work in radians
- % is interpreted directly as /100, as per the name "per-cent"
- ! denotes a factorial
- || denotes the absolute value or modulus 
- (), [], {}:
	- all converted to () for internal consistency
	- converted to nesting order for output (if desired)
	- nesting order is () for innermost, [] for middle, {} for outermost.
	- e.g.: {[(x+y)*z] + (a-b)}

exceptions:
- * instead of x or × or ⋅
- / instead of ÷
- <= >= instead of ≤ ≥

exclusions:
- : is not used to denote ratio or division
- ± and ∓ due to rarity/inaccessiblity of symbols
- √ due to inaccessibility of symbol. the alternative is sqrt() or ()^0.5

notes:
- ∧ and ^ are not the same. the former is not used
- middle school and high school students are taught () {} [] but since {} is reserved for sets, piecewise functions, ..., formal academic notation prefers () [] {}

# the tricky stuff -------------------------------------------------------------

1. piecewise functions:
piecewise functions are most commonly written as:
	f(x) = {expression if condition, expression if condition, ...}

however, the curly brackets and the "f(x)" are redundant for our purpose. so:
	"expression if condition, expression if condition"

as an example, see the modulus function |x|:
	"x if x>0, -x if x<0"

piecewise expressions may be identified with the "if" keyword
each piece is delimited by the comma ','

2. multiple outputs:
multiple outputs are most commonly written as:
"f(x) = x^2, g(x) = x*4"
"x = f(x), g(x)

there are many ways, but preferably ones that do not clash with piecewise notation
a comma ',' may be used when it is not piecewise. e.g:
	"x+2, x-2"
	this also allows it to represent parametric functions
as an example, see the parametric form of a circle:
	(cos(t), sin(t))
