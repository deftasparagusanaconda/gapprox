what new things does hana bring to the table?

hana:
- high-schooler-level intuitive API
- brings together single evaluation, iterative regression, symbolic regression (and also structure regression)
- not a black-box machine (its clear how it works)
- mathematically grounded
- plugin architecture (users can easily make their own number set, paramgen, ...)
- esoteric objective function support (beyond accuracy and simplicity)

hana.approximator:
- supports input as string, DAG, callable, iterable (points)
- automatic best approximation chooser

hana.regressor:
- custom multithreading strategy
- objective-aware pareto front

hana.DAG:
- custom esoteric functions (if(a,b,c), lerp(a,b,c), variadic, power mean, ...)
- double-stored edges (allows back & front propagation)
- DAG to tree, tree to DAG conversion
- CISC to RISC, RISC to CISC conversion (canonicalization & decanonicalization)
- number set preservation (boolean, whole, rational, complex, ...)
- vector support
- custom number sets
- custom functions, names, anything can be made into a node
- arbitrary precision support
- (in the future) hypercomplex support
- inf, -inf, 0.0, -0.0, nan support

hana.visualizer:
- supports n dimensions
- can visualize both DAGs and plots
- interactive DAG manipulation
- live updates
