if gapprox is ultimately trying to find a relation, a relation isnt usually neatly described by an expression. well.. sometimes.. in the case of a function. but in cases like an inequality or an equality or such, we need to find the characteristic function. AKA the indicator function. because a relation is just a subset of the cartesian product of all the domains. and an indicator function basically takes a tuple of elements from each domain and returns a boolean: whether that tuple is valid or not.

but how does one measure a relation? we can measure functions but how for relations? does my objectives.py have to grow?

-----------------

relatins are just a set of tuples. how many ways can we represent them?

equations
inequations
geometric shapes
parametric equations
bezier curves
piecewise
interval
