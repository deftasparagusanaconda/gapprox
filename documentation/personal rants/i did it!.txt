i did it!! i finally did it! i overhauled the DAG system. now it uses a clean direct storage plus a str with a context dict. and now everything is substituted very seamlessly. the DAG only holds structure, and no semantics. the context dict holds semantics but no structure. its perfectly separated. i think its better than before. especially considering that i had so many different kinds of classes for every small bit of the engine that i was thinking about. now its all clean and ive captured the essence of it. im doing really well!!
