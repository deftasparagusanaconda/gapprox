for the two error functions:

SMAPE = |a-b|/(|a|/2+|b|/2)
log error = |log(a/b)|

these two are essentially the same, but for difference and ratio respectively
plot them on a 3d graphing calculator like geogebra and they show almost same
but log error can go to inf while SMAPE will not


additionally, log error can implement any base
but when natural logarithm is used, it follows SMAPE most closely
