it seems there are two kinds of constants. and that plain numbers are constants, not parameters.

lets redefine things.

variables are things that are substituted upon evaluation
parameters are things that an improvement engine changes
constants are things that dont change

there are two kinds of constants. named constants like π or e and literal constants like 2, 3

lets look at an expression:

px²y + qxy² + sin(πxy)

variables: x, y
parameters: p, q
named constants: π
literal constants: 2, 2
operators: +, +
functions: sin

a variable has a name that we refer to it by
a parameter has a name. an iterative optimization engine holds values for it
a named constant has a name. it also usually has a value too, although we refer to it mainly by the name. it doesnt change
a literal constant has a value, but no name. it doesnt change
an operator is a function with special semantics and precedence
a function has a name and a list of instructions. it is something that takes input and gives output.

this whole thing would preferably be wrapped in an Expression object.



ahhhhh
