graphapproximator is a modular, expressive library for approximating curves using parameterizers, mathematical expressions, etc	

the underlying codebase may change but the api must always remain the same

the API must operate easily like:

import graphapproximator as ga

myinput = [2,3,5,4]
ga(myinput)
# returns a linear least squares approximation

ga.input = [9,2,3]
ga.parameterizer = ga.parameterizers.discrete_fourier_transform
ga.expression = ga.expressions.fourier_series
ga()
ga.show()
