the project will be versioned as major.minor.patch:
0.1.0 = first PyPI commit, minimal features, but usable
1.0.0 = first official release
x.0.0 = breaking changes, refactoring, etc
x.y.0 = new features, but backward-compatible
x.y.z = bug fixes

the minimum viable product (MVP) will be released as 0.1.0 on PyPI
it should:
	- accept points input (as two lists)
	- approximate it using line regression
	- plot result interactively (matplotlib or browser-based)
	- API that supports:
		- ga.input = ([x1,x2,x3,...], [y1,y2,y3,y4])
		- ga.analyzers = ga.analyzers.line.least_squares
		- ga.expression = ga.expressions.polynomial
		- ga.approximate()	# same as ga()
		- ga.plot()
		- ga.line()
		- ga.transpose()	# transpose list of tuples [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), ...] to tuple of lists ([x1,x2,x3,...], [y1,y2,y3,...])
