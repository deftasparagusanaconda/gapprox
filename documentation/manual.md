# üëã introduction </summary>
gapprox is a python toolkit to find the approximate function of a [graph][graph of a function]  
instead of "find the graph of a function", youre flipping it: "find the function of a graph"

gapprox helps streamline the process of graph approximation

# üíæ installation </summary>
get it from PyPI: 
```shell
pip install gapprox
```

or install the latest from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/gapprox
cd gapprox
pip install .
```

for faster performance, install with all optional dependencies:
```shell
pip install gapprox[all]
```

# üìó basic guide </summary>
basic usage:
```python
import gapprox

function = gapprox.fit([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])

print(function)
print(function(2.5))
```

`import gapprox` loads the gapprox package into python  
`.fit()` selects the best approximation method and returns an [Expression](#expression)  
you can print the Expression `print(function)` or call it like a function `function(2.5)`

# üìô intermediate guide </summary>
this is for users who want more control and familiarity with gapprox. it should take you 5 minutes to read through this. follow the given example:
```python
import gapprox as ga

graph = ga.Approximator(
    paramgen = ga.paramgens.line.least_squares
    structgen = ga.structgens.polynomial
)

function = graph.evaluate([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])    # calculate an approximation with the given configuration

print(function)
print(function(3.5))
```

```python
import gapprox as ga

graph = ga.Optimizer(

function = graph.evaluate(

print(function)
print(function(3.5))
```

# üìï advanced guide </summary>  

this is for users who want to understand how gapprox works  

## Expression </summary>
an Expression is an object representing a mathematical function. it is printable and callable. internally it uses one of three systems:
- [directed acyclic graph][DAG]        (not implemented yet)
- [binary expression tree][BET]        (not implemented yet)
- [sympy expression][sympy expression] (not implemented yet)

[DAG]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph
[BET]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree
[sympy expression]: https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/manipulation.html

# üöÄ roadmap </summary>

- DAG/expression trees  
- multi-objective analysis (and [pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) presentation)  
- web app  
- symbolic regression  
- complex numbers  
- parametric function support  
- multiple-input multiple-output
- n-dimensional plotters  
- surface approximation  
- [many-to-many][relation types] relation approximation  
- point density evaluators  
- hypersonic blasters üöÄ

in the far far future, ga will support multiple-input multiple-output approximation. for m inputs and n outputs, it runs n approximations of m-dimensional [manifolds][manifold] separately  
effectively, this turns it into a general-purpose prediction library, analogous to AI  
currently, ga only supports single-input single-output [many-to-one][relation types] functions

# ü§ù contributing </summary>

gapprox is currently not looking for contributors. solo dev work is required to get a good structure going. "if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself"  

anyway, gapprox follows semantic versioning as `major`.`minor`.`bugfix`  
`X.0.0` - big overhaul | non-backwards compatible  
`X.Y.0` - new features | backwards compatible  
`X.Y.Z` - bug fixes | minor features
