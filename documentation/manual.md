# üëã introduction </summary>
gapprox is a python toolkit to find the approximate function of a [graph][graph of a function]  
instead of "find the graph of a function", youre flipping it: "find the function of a graph"

gapprox helps streamline the process of graph approximation

# üíæ installation </summary>
get it from PyPI: 
```shell
pip install gapprox
```

or install the latest from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/gapprox
cd gapprox
pip install .
```

for faster performance, install with all optional dependencies:
```shell
pip install gapprox[all]
```

# üìó basic guide </summary>
basic usage:
```python
import gapprox

function = gapprox.fit([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])

print(function)
print(function(2.5))
```

`import gapprox` loads the gapprox package into python  
`.fit()` selects the best approximation method and returns an [Expression](#expression)  
you can print the Expression `print(function)` or call it like a function `function(2.5)`

# üìô intermediate guide </summary>
this is for users who want more control and familiarity with gapprox. it should take you 5 minutes to read through this. follow the given example:
```python
import gapprox as ga

graph = ga.Approximation(
    paramgen = ga.paramgens.line.least_squares
    structgen = ga.structgens.polynomial
)

function = graph.evaluate([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])    # calculate an approximation with the given configuration

print(function)
print(function(3.5))
```

gapprox uses `Approximation` to remember how to 

```python
import gapprox as ga

graph = ga.Optimizer(

function = graph.evaluate(

print(function)
print(function(3.5))
```

# üìï advanced guide </summary>  

this is for users who want to understand how gapprox works. you are not expected to read everything so dont worry. read only what you need!

<details><summary>

## Expression </summary>
an [object template][class]. it represents a mathematical expression like `2*x + 3` or `sin(x)`  
it is [callable][callable], meaning you can evaluate it if you substitute the variables. it is also printable. the syntax is similar to sympy:

```python
import gapprox as ga

x = ga.symbol("x")

expr = ga.Expression("2*x + 3")
print(expr(x=2))    # same as print(expr.subs(x=2))

# 7
```

if the variables are not completely substituted, it returns a simplified Expression:
```python
import gapprox as ga

x, y = ga.symbol("x", "y")

expr = ga.Expression("2*x + 3*y + 4")
print(expr(x=2))    # same as print(expr.subs(x=2))

# 3*y + 7
```

it uses one of any three internal systems, morphing on-the-fly as appropriate:

- directed acyclic graph ([gapprox.Dag](#dag))
- binary expression tree ([gapprox.Tree](#tree))
- [sympy expression][sympy expression] (used only if specified in the [constructor][constructor] arguments as `Expression(force_sympy=True)`

## structgen </summary>
a [callable][callable] function. it generates the structure of Expression

# üìö dev notes </summary>

this section is for me and contributors to understand how the implementation works, and why some choices were made. not meant for users (but you're welcome to peek too ^ ∑^)

<details><summary>

## Dag </summary>
an [object template][class]. it represents a [directed acyclic graph][DAG] by storing a collection of nodes

it uses one of any three internal systems, morphing on-the-fly as appropriate

- adjacency list
- adjacency matrix
- edges list
</details><details><summary>

## Tree </summary>
an [object template][class]. it represents a [binary expression tree][BET] by storing a collection of nodes. it is very similar to [gapprox.Dag](#dag) except it allows only [binary functions][binary function]

</details><details><summary>

### polynomials </summary>

polynomials are stored as an array of terms. each term is stored as [coefficient, [exponent1, exponent2, exponent3, ...]] this is better than a tensor representation because:
1. if there are only a few terms, the tensor becomes a sparse tensor, wasting a lot of reserved memory
2. the tensor will support only whole-number coefficients
3. it can store large coefficients without having to reserve large memory. for example, x^1000
4. it allows different data types for coefficents and exponents

storing terms in this way allows us to store fractional polynomials; for example x^2.5 + 3 is stored as [[1, 2.5], [3]]

alternatively, if we want to store integer exponents, a term may be stored as [float coefficent, int exponent_array[]]. additionally, on the off-chance that the exponent_array is itself a sparse vector (i.e. each term has only a few variables in it), we may store it as a coordinate list. there are numerous ways to do so.

gapprox does not have a special Polynomial class for this for a few reasons:
1. non-conventional and data-dependent physical storage strategy
2. Expression is powerful enough to handle storing polynomials
3. most polynomials have few terms anyway
4. it introduces an unnecessary class

# üöÄ roadmap </summary>

- DAG/expression trees  
- multi-objective analysis (and [pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) presentation)  
- web app  
- symbolic regression  
- complex numbers  
- parametric function support  
- multiple-input multiple-output
- n-dimensional plotters  
- surface approximation  
- [many-to-many][relation types] relation approximation  
- point density evaluators  
- hypersonic blasters üöÄ

in the far far future, ga will support multiple-input multiple-output approximation. for m inputs and n outputs, it runs n approximations of m-dimensional [manifolds][manifold] separately  
effectively, this turns it into a general-purpose prediction library, analogous to AI  
currently, ga only supports single-input single-output [many-to-one][relation types] functions

# ü§ù contributing </summary>

gapprox is currently not looking for contributors. solo dev work is required to get a good structure going. "if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself"  

anyway, gapprox follows semantic versioning as `major`.`minor`.`bugfix`  
`X.0.0` - big overhaul | non-backwards compatible  
`X.Y.0` - new features | backwards compatible  
`X.Y.Z` - bug fixes | minor features
