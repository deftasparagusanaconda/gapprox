# üëã introduction
</summary>

gapprox is a python toolkit to find the approximate function of a [graph][graph of a function]  
instead of "find the graph of a function", youre flipping it: "find the function of a graph"

gapprox helps streamline the process of graph approximation

# üíæ installation
</summary>

get it from PyPI: 
```shell
pip install gapprox
```

or install the latest from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/gapprox
cd gapprox
pip install .
```

for faster performance, install with all optional dependencies:
```shell
pip install gapprox[all]
```

# üìó basic guide
</summary>

this is the basic "i want results!" guide  
follow the example:
```python
import gapprox

graph = gapprox.Approximation()
function = graph.fit([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])

print(function)
print(function(2.5))

```  
`import gapprox` loads the gapprox package into python
`Approximation()` creates an object that manages configuration (input, output, fitting method, ...)  
`.fit()` automatically selects the best approximation method, returning an [Expression](###Expression)
you can print the Expression `print(graph.output)` or call it like a function `graph.output(2.5)`

# üìô intermediate guide 
</summary>

this is the intermediate "i want control!" guide

### Expression
an Expression is an object representing a mathematical function either as a DAG (directed acyclic graph) or as a tree. it is printable and callable.

# üöÄ roadmap
</summary>

- DAG/expression trees  
- multi-objective analysis (and [pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) presentation)  
- web app  
- symbolic regression  
- complex numbers  
- parametric function support  
- multiple-input multiple-output
- n-dimensional plotters  
- surface approximation  
- [many-to-many][relation types] relation approximation  
- point density evaluators  
- hypersonic blasters üöÄ

in the far far future, ga will support multiple-input multiple-output approximation. for m inputs and n outputs, it runs n approximations of m-dimensional [manifolds][manifold] separately  
effectively, this turns it into a general-purpose prediction library, analogous to AI  
currently, ga only supports single-input single-output [many-to-one][relation types] functions

# ü§ù contributing
</summary>

gapprox is currently not looking for contributors. solo dev work is required to get a good structure going. "if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself"  

anyway, gapprox follows semantic versioning as `major`.`minor`.`bugfix`  
`X.0.0` - big overhaul | non-backwards compatible  
`X.Y.0` - new features | backwards compatible  
`X.Y.Z` - bug fixes | minor features
