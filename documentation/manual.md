gapprox is a python toolkit to find the approximate function of a [graph][graph of a function]  
instead of "find the graph of a function", youre flipping it: "find the function of a graph"

gapprox helps streamline the process of graph approximation

get it from PyPI: 
```shell
pip install gapprox
```

or install the latest from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/deftasparagusanaconda/gapprox
cd gapprox
pip install .
```

for faster performance, install with all optional dependencies:
```shell
pip install gapprox[all]
```

# üìó basic guide </summary>
--- 
```python
import gapprox

expr = gapprox.fit([1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2])

print(expr)
print(expr(2.5))
```

`import gapprox` loads the gapprox package into python  
`gapprox.fit()` automatically selects the best approximation method and returns an [Expression](#expression)  
you can print the Expression `print(expr)` or call it like a function `expr(2.5)`

this is for users who want more control and familiarity with gapprox. it should take you 5 minutes to read through this. 

gapprox uses the [Approximation](#approximation) and [Expression](#expression) classes extensively. click on them to read them in the advanced guide!

besides `gapprox.fit()`, there are two other ways to approximate a graph: single evaluation (calculate once) and iterative optimization (keep improving the approximation)

single evaluation
---
```python
import gapprox as ga

approx = ga.Approximation(
    input = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2],
    paramgen = ga.paramgens.line.least_squares,
    structgen = ga.structgens.polynomial
)

approx.evaluate()

print(approx.output)
print(approx.output(2.5))
```

`approx` is an [object][object] that stores `input`, `paramgen`, `structgen`, `output`

`approx.evaluate()` returns the approximate [Expression](#expression) and also stores it into `approx.output`

iterative optimization
---

```python
import gapprox as ga

approx = ga.Approximation(
    input = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 2],
    paramgen = ga.paramgens.line.least_squares,
    structgen = ga.structgens.polynomial
)

optimizer = ga.Optimizer()

optimizer.optimize(approx)    # same as optimizer(approx)

print(approx.output)
print(approx.output(2.5))
```

`optimizer` is a [stateful] function-like object. basically, its a function with settings you can configure, although most of that is done for you. it also remembers its previous guesses and such. its main job is to improve an approximation by running an optimization/regression algorithm step by step.

notice that you need not even use `approx.evaluate()` first! if `approx.output` is not supplied, `optimizer` automatically runs `approx.evaluate()`. if even `paramgen` and `structgen` are not supplied, `optimizer` will simply start guessing from nothing

this is for users who want to understand how gapprox works. you are not expected to read everything so dont worry. read only what you need!

<details><summary>

## gapprox.fit() </summary>

a [callable][callable] function. it uses an AI model to run the most appropriate approximation model, and returns an [Expression](#expression)
</details><details><summary>

## gapprox.Expression
</summary>  
an [object template][class]. it represents a mathematical expression like `2*x + 3` or `sin(x)`  
it is [callable][callable], meaning you can evaluate it if you substitute the variables. it is also printable. the syntax is similar to sympy:

```python
import gapprox as ga

x = ga.symbol("x")

expr = ga.Expression("2*x + 3")
print(expr(x=2))    # same as print(expr.subs(x=2))

# 7
```

if the variables are not completely substituted, it returns a simplified Expression:
```python
import gapprox as ga

x, y = ga.symbol("x", "y")

expr = ga.Expression("2*x + 3*y + 4")
print(expr(x=2))    # same as print(expr.subs(x=2))

# 3*y + 7
```

it uses one of any three internal systems, morphing on-the-fly as appropriate:

- directed acyclic graph ([gapprox.Dag](#dag))
- binary expression tree ([gapprox.Tree](#tree))
- [sympy expression][sympy expression] (used only if specified in the [constructor][constructor] arguments as `Expression(force_sympy=True)`

# üìö dev notes </summary>

this section is for me and contributors to understand how the implementation works, and why some choices were made. not meant for users (but you're welcome to peek too ^ ∑^)


<details><summary>

## Dag </summary>
an [object template][class]. it represents a [directed acyclic graph][DAG] by storing a collection of nodes

it uses one of any three internal systems, morphing on-the-fly as appropriate

- adjacency list
- adjacency matrix
- edges list
</details><details><summary>

## Tree </summary>
an [object template][class]. it represents a [binary expression tree][BET] by storing a collection of nodes. it is very similar to [gapprox.Dag](#dag) except it allows only [binary functions][binary function]

</details><details><summary>

## polynomials </summary>

polynomials are stored as an array of terms. each term is stored as [coefficient, [exponent1, exponent2, exponent3, ...]] this is better than a tensor representation because:
1. if there are only a few terms, the tensor becomes a sparse tensor, wasting a lot of reserved memory
2. the tensor will support only whole-number coefficients
3. it can store large coefficients without having to reserve large memory. for example, x^1000
4. it allows different data types for coefficents and exponents

storing terms in this way allows us to store fractional polynomials; for example x^2.5 + 3 is stored as [[1, 2.5], [3]]

alternatively, if we want to store integer exponents, a term may be stored as [float coefficent, int exponent_array[]]. additionally, on the off-chance that the exponent_array is itself a sparse vector (i.e. each term has only a few variables in it), we may store it as a coordinate list. there are numerous ways to do so.

gapprox does not have a special Polynomial class for this for a few reasons:
1. non-conventional and data-dependent physical storage strategy
2. Expression is powerful enough to handle storing polynomials
3. most polynomials have few terms anyway
4. it introduces an unnecessary class

</details><details><summary>

## versioning </summary>

gapprox follows [semantic versioning][semver] as `major`.`minor`.`patch`  

`major` - backward-incompatible API changes  
`minor` - backward-compatible features  
`patch` - backward-compatible bug fixes  

[semver]: https://semver.org/

</details><details><summary>

## performance </summary>

gapprox is feature-oriented and is not particularly focused on performance (down to reasonable bounds of course)

to enhance performance, certain functions or parts of gapprox may use external libraries if they are present, such as `scipy.fft` instead of a custom FFT implementation

furthermore, certain critical parts of gapprox may be directly compiled to C using Cython. it might yield a performance increase of 2x at not much inconvenience (although this is not done in the official gapprox implementation for simplicity reasons)

# üöÄ roadmap </summary>
---
- `gapprox.fit()` automatic graph fitting
- DAG/expression trees  
- multi-objective analysis (and [pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) presentation)  
- web app  
- symbolic regression  
- complex numbers  
- parametric function support  
- multiple-input multiple-output
- n-dimensional plotters  
- surface approximation  
- [many-to-many][relation types] relation approximation  
- point density evaluators  
- hypersonic blasters üöÄ

in the far far future, ga will support multiple-input multiple-output approximation. for m inputs and n outputs, it runs n approximations of m-dimensional [manifolds][manifold] separately  
effectively, this turns it into a general-purpose prediction library, analogous to AI  
currently, ga only supports single-input single-output [many-to-one][relation types] functions
