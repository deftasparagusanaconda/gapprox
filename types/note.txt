# numbers as people with sex and gender ----------------------------------------

numbers like 10 are born Natural but may identify as an Integer, in which case it will be treated as such and participate in subtraction for example
numbers like 0 are born Whole but may identify even as a Complex

gapprox's number system is non-cisnormative; i.e., it does not like to assume cis gender. when a Number is instancized, it shall be instancized with a clear definition of its structure. it shall not be assigned the lowest compatible number type. the user should know beforehand what kind of number it should be, but this should be done discretely. instead of Number(value, structure) like Number(23, Integer), we let them do Integer(23) and now Integer is a subclass of Number. this way, we distract them from the fact that we are actually storing the structure of the number.

this analogy breaks down when we consider numbers like -10: born as NegativeInteger but tries to identify as a Natural
this is not allowed, but in the real world, we like people to be able to identify as anything without constraints.
