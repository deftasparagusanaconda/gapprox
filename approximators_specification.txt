"approximators" are functions which take in an array of numbers and output "for now"
a string, which describes a continuous f(x) to approximate the input as closely as possible.

the input array will be assumed to be the y-values for a set of points.
the x-values for this set of points will be assumed to be {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
therefore the approximators only take in same-x-interval points.

the output will always be a continuous function. the representation may vary
but is currently standardized to be a string.
